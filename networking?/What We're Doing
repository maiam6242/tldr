What We Are Doing

Working on a PDF parsing software specifically geared toward human trafficking.
We have been testing our programs with the Massachusetts State Police and were looking
to expand to other units. Essentially, our software expedites the process that
it takes to build a case. It can take in any PDF files and will gather then
sort images of keywords (yours or ones that we have preinputted-- or both!) in
context as well as create a summary sheet of the findings.
